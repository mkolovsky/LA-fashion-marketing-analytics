🧵 Overview
This project explores optimal locations in Los Angeles County to open new clothing retail stores based on store survival rates, market saturation, and co-location patterns. We aimed to answer the business question:

"Where should we open a new clothing store in LA County to maximize survival and growth potential?"

🔍 Methodology
Data Collection: Extracted historical business license data for clothing stores across LA County

Feature Engineering: Created survival curves and categorized store types

Clustering: Grouped zip codes based on store density, survival trends, and demographics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified hotspots for high survival and underserved markets

📈 Key Insights
High survival clusters include Claremont, Agoura, and Northridge/Canoga Park

Over 50% of stores close within 6 years, with the highest churn between years 2–4

Women’s and General Apparel stores have high co-location synergies

2009 was a turning point: more store closures than openings, lingering through the 2010s

🧭 Recommendations
Launch new stores in Claremont, Agoura, and Maywood to balance opportunity and stability

Avoid Downtown LA and Santa Monica for now due to high saturation and rent

Future enhancements: integrate lease pricing, foot traffic estimates, and ROI modeling for investment prioritization

🔗 Project Outcomes
Informed market-entry strategy for boutique or general apparel brands

Framework for expanding into untapped, high-survival regions in LA County

Usable by fashion retailers, commercial real estate investors, and retail analytics teams
